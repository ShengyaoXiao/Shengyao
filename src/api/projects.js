                description: "Furnitrade is a furniture trading platform where its users can browse furniture, contact the sellers, and post information about the furniture that they want to sell. <br/><br/> The idea of Furnitrade was born when we, as college students who were on a budget, always complained that it's difficult to find cheap second-hand furniture or sell them at a fair price: When we want to buy some cheap used furniture, we often spent lots of time searching and comparing products from different platforms. When we want to sell used furniture, we had to post them on different platforms as well. Plus we might encounter with potentially untrusted buyers and sellers. <br/><br/>Therefore, Furnitrade is designed to improve used furniture trading experience by providing organized information about furniture as well as quick, trustful access to sellers. <br/><br/> Technologies used: React.js, Flask, and MongoDB. <br/><br/> If you want to know more about Furnitrade, feel free to watch the demo.",

This design and development focused on the human-centered design process. <br/><br/> We started this project by need-finding, which means that we observed and interviewed people and identified user needs. Based on the user needs that we found, we concluded a core problem that we intended to solve. With the problem, we spent the next two weeks drawing the storyboards and paper prototypes. Then we showed our prototypes to our classmates, and we did heuristic evaluations, which I found was the most interesting part of the course. Through heuristic evaluations, we received useful feedback from our classmates, and then we were able to make revisions on the prototypes. Once we were satisfied with our prototypes, we started to implement the app and do various kinds of testing on the app. I found user testing was helpful for us to understand the usersâ€™ mental models. <br/><br/> If you want to know more about Monster Fighter, feel free to watch the demo.
